# RBAC
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your organization.

## Role and RoleBinding
A role binding grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users. It holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference to the role being granted. A RoleBinding grants permissions within a specific namespace whereas a ClusterRoleBinding grants that access cluster-wide.
